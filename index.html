          I am taking this course because I worked on a project this summer
          during my internship at FanDuel where I extracted  user
          location data and visualized it in Tableau to get a better understanding of our users' betting behavior. Leveraging this geo-data allowed us to develop many insights and provide our users with a better experience on our platform. This project piqued my interest in
          data visualization and now I am on the pursuit of more knowledge.

                    <h2>Insightful Data Visualization Example: <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/home-price-index" target="_blank">Mapping Home Price Changes</a></h2>
                    <p>Note: I am referring to the "NATIONAL PRICES" graphic.<br> <br>This data visualization provides an interactive map of the US with a heat mapping showing the changes in home values per region since the previous year. The map allows the user to zoom in and out to get more granular in the area they are searching for information in. Furthermore, when a user hovers over a particular region, the map shows the exact percentage change from the previous year in home values. There is also a key at the top of the graphic showing what the different colors represent, with warmer colors indicating a decline in home prices and cooler colors indicating a rise. I think this graphic does a tremendous job visualizing the data and allows me, as a user, to identify trends across the US in a very seamless manner. </p>

                    <p>Note: I am referring to the graphic at the very top of the webpage. <br> <br>This data visualization also shows the changes in home value per region since the previous year, but does a much more lackluster job in doing so. First and foremost, the graph colors regions in different shades, but there is no “key” to let me understand what the different colors mean. I am left to make assumptions about areas with increased home prices and thus am not getting an accurate representation of the data at hand. Secondly, this map is not interactive and I have no ability to zoom in or out and be more granular in my pursuit of information; I am left to draw conclusions from a very high level. Lastly, there is no manner in which I can see the exact percentage change of the various regions. While I may see that one area of the country has home prices that are rising faster than another area, I have no way to truly understand how much quicker they are rising. </p>
